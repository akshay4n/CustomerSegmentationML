Objectives<br>
• Improve customer satisfaction<br>
• Reduce wastage of unwanted products<br>
• Improve marketing strategy<br>
• Targeting audience on the basis of their needs.<br>

Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning(K-means clustering algorithm)<br>
  * Customer behavioural traits like number of products ordered, average return rate and total spending were taken
  into account, scaled data by logarithmic scaling.
  * Predicted relevant customer segmentation groups using k-means clustering algorithm
